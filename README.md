Distribution Analysis of Mitochondria in Confocal Images
# 1 Abstract
Mitochondria are essential organelles involved in energy production, ROS generation, and ion homeostasis, with their distribution in cells dynamically changing in response to stress conditions. The spatial and temporal position of the mitochondria perhaps meets the functional needs of the cell. Previous research supports that heat shock causes perinuclear mitochondrial accumulation in mammalian cells. This study aims to enhance our understanding of mitochondrial distribution. Mitochondrial clustering patterns were analyzed in confocal microscopy images through K-means clustering and contour detection methods.
Angular lines were employed to measure distances between perinuclear, central, radial zones and the nucleus, revealing distinct spatial relationships. This research contributes to understanding mitochondrial dynamics in cellular responses to stress, with implications for biomedical research and therapeutic strategies.
